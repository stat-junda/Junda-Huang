I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/).  
Before this, I received my M.S. in Statistics and Data Science from [Northwestern University](https://statistics.northwestern.edu) in 2025, advised by Prof. [Bradly Stadie](https://bstadie.github.io), Prof. [Noelle I Samia](https://statistics.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/noelle-samia.html), and Prof. [Lihui Zhao](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=22039).  
I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from the [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2021, where I was mentored by Prof. [Yong Li](https://bs.ustc.edu.cn/english/profile-22.html).  

My earlier research interests were in **machine learning and reinforcement learning**.  
Currently, I am especially interested in **causal inference**.
